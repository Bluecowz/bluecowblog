### Learning From My First Failure

In college I co-hosted a podcast titled, The College Gamers Podcast. The show originally was me and my now wife playing and reviewing games that were $10 or less on steam. The idea was that college students are poor and don't have a lot of spend on video games so we would find the good games for them. The show wasn't a true podcast as each "episode" would be submitted to a more popular show and tacked on as a segment. We only submitted eight or so episodes before school work got too busy.

The next year I swapped my major from Physics to Computer Science and magically had time for hobbies. I started the podcast again as a full fledged show and asked a buddy from high school to host it with me. The show had a structure beginning with a news segment and then followed by another segment that would rotate. I would experiment with different quizes and ideas to find cool things that would seem fun. We would record in my bedroom with a two mic setup and it was very tedious. Later I asked another one of my friends to join which was a weird move in hindsight. The other two cohosts didn't know each other and chemstry was hard. 

In the end, the show ran for 124 episodes not including specials and interviews which would be posted separately. 

The College Gamers Podcast, while I feel failed as a podcast was one of my favorite creative projects I have made. I learned a lot from creating it and have a few theories on why the show failed. 

### Finding A Niche
* A show for everyone and no one will listen

### A Good Team
* I knew everyone but they did not know each other

### An Oversaturated Market
* Online Ads Failed

 **Note On The Embarrassing Question About Screen Size**
