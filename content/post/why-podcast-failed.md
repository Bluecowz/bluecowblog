### Learning From My First Failure

In college I co-hosted a podcast titled, The College Gamers Podcast. The show originally was me and my now wife playing and reviewing games that were $10 or less on steam. The idea was that college students are poor and don't have a lot of spend on video games so we would find the good games for them. The show wasn't a true podcast as each "episode" would be submitted to a more popular show and tacked on as a segment. We only submitted eight or so episodes before school work got too busy.

The next year I swapped my major from Physics to Computer Science and magically had time for hobbies. I started the podcast again as a full fledged show and asked a buddy from high school to host it with me. The show had a structure beginning with a news segment and then followed by another segment that would rotate. I would experiment with different quizzes and ideas to find cool things that would seem fun. We would record in my bedroom with a two mic setup and it was very tedious. Later I asked another one of my friends to join which was a weird move in hindsight. The other two cohosts didn't know each other and chemistry was hard. 

In the end, the show ran for 124 episodes not including specials and interviews which would be posted separately. 

The College Gamers Podcast, while I feel failed as a podcast was one of my favorite creative projects I have made. I learned a lot from creating it and have a few theories on why the show failed. 

### *Finding A Niche*

* #Idea Summary
* A show for everyone and no one will listen
* General shows work when you are leveraging an existing audience 

In hindsight, this seems like an obvious mistake. The College Gamers Podcast never really targeted a specific genre, style, or platform. We really talked about whatever we wanted to and because we talked about everything we have *no reason* anyone would want to listen.  I think another part of it is the belief in the fallacy of "If you build it, they will come". When you are talking to your friends about topics you all enjoy you are entertained. However, because you are entertained that doesn't mean people listening to you will be. Speaking to entertain others not engaged in conversation (i.e. a podcast) seems to be a different kind of conversation.

Placing yourself in a niche also makes you more discoverable. Googling "video game podcast" pulls up 794,000,000 results as google suggesting ~45 different shows all video game themed. 

In comparison, for a short stent I put3together a podcast centered around the borderlands series because I was excited for Borderlands 3. The show didn't run very long because the passion wasn't there like I though. Also, embarrassingly, I never finished Borderlands 2 which landed a bad review or two. This show had more success and engagement in the month or two it ran than the 2ish years The College Gamers Podcast ran for. 

I learned that market research is important because it help you identify a niche you can target.
