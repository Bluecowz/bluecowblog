# Howdy

My name is Mike. I like writing software and solving problems.

This blog is place to write down ideas. Writing things out helps me understand them and elebrorate on ideas. I was not good in English class and there will be many typos and awkard sentences.

Currently I am working for a Fortune 500 company but I would rather be working on my own business.

I started playing World of Warcraft in 2007 and my first serious character was a Tauren Hunter. His name was Bluecow.

I currently reside in Alabama with my wife and two corgis, Cooper and Jaina.
